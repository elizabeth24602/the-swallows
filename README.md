# User Centric Frontend Development
## Milestone Project
### The Swallows
My first milestone project is entitled The Swallows. The User Centric Frontend Development 
project was to create a website for a 1960’s Rock Band or you could develop your own 
individual project. I developed my own. I loosely followed the brief to design The Swallows. 
They are a 4 piece girl band from Manchester, England. The webpage is aimed at existing fans 
and possible new ones. It is designed to showcase their new music and information about the 
girls. It is also designed to make it easy access to find what they are looking for such as 
contact info and their latest shows. I have created a frontend only website consisting of six 
pages. 
##### The business goals of this website are:
• Build brand awareness. 
• Provide information on upcoming shows and where to hear the band play. 
• Provide contact info to ensure all users are kept up to date. 
• Excellent UX to keep potential fans on site long enough to obtain all information they would 
need. 
##### The customer goals of this website are:
• Searching for where to hear The Swallows play or general data. 
• Find contact information and social sites. 
• Clear and easy to find background material about the band. 
### UX
This website is aimed at existing fans and possible new ones. It showcases new songs, 
information on the band and clear ways to contact them. It also lists their upcoming shows 
with times and locations. (B2B) As a developer I wanted to create a colour scheme across all 5 
pages to allow the website to flow, there would be no drastic changes and I ultimately wanted 
the user experience to be almost calming so it subconsciously gives The Swallows an aura of 
relaxation. (B2B & B2C) I also wanted the navigation system to be fairly simple so the user 
knows where the menu is sending them. Nothing ambiguous. I looked at many band websites and 
forums of what fans wanted. The main inspiration was a website for an American duo ‘Steel 
Blossoms’. The style of their website was something I was keen to try and recreate. (B2C) 

https://balsamiq.cloud/sjb1q9r/pmq7w3i/r012F

I started off by using publisher to create my wireframes but then moved onto Balsamiq to 
create the other pages. This is mainly because I find the layout on Balsamiq easier to use but 
the colour and font elements on publisher opens more creative avenues. 
### Features
#### Header
The very first feature you will see are social links. These will link the user to said social 
sights. They are on the top left of the page and they are only small to essentially be a 
feature elements. It gives users different ways of connecting with the band. The social links 
are placed on every page in the header and footer again equalling easy access. I then have a 
search bar at the top. This is designed so users can type in specific content and be taken to 
it straight away without having to filter through the other elements. This is part of the 
header so is featured on every page. The header also contains a the title of the band “The 
Swallows” this takes up a large proportion of the screen and is this positioned in the centre. 
Then when viewing on a mobile device the text flows better. The menu bar is again featured on 
every page. They are linked to each individual page for easy navigation. There is a 
hvr-sweep-to-bottom so it adds to the aesthetic of the page. 
#### Footer
The footer is also featured on every page. There are six pages in total with the Header and 
Footer being present on each. There is a menu bar in the footer, listing the pages of the 
website, next to that is a list of the girls names and finally at the bottom right of the page 
there are the social links just promoting other ways you can follow the band The bootstrap 
grid method has been utilised on every page just with the layout being slightly different. 
#### Section
##### Home
The Homepage of the band. It features their latest album cover and a link to their new 
release. But not really much information. Just enough to grab attention, focusing on colour 
schemes and the use of different fonts. This page works as a set up for the rest of the 
website. 
##### Bio
This page focuses on the back story of the band. How they met/formed. As aforementioned every 
page includes the Header and the Footer elements. 
##### Meet
This page entitled Meet the Band is two columns wide with four rows each row contains an image 
of each of the girls and a short bio on each of them. 
##### Shows
The Shows page features a table showing each show and location. Underneath there are quotes 
from people who are fans of the band, also a picture can be found on the right of the screen.
##### Music 
Currently the Music page doesn't have any content. I wanted to add audio and video clips of 
the band but unfortunatley I do not have any. 
##### Contact
This is three columns of contact info, booking contact, press contact and label contact. All 
avenues are covered here as all contacts are accessible. 
##### Existing Features
• Header Navigation Bar - Exists on every page and allows all users to easily navigate all the 
website's pages and find what they are looking for quickly. 
• Header Title – Exists on every page acts almost like a logo but doesn’t link to the 
homepage. • Header Social Icons – Exists on every page and allows all users to access the 
social platforms that the artist uses. 
• Header Search Bar - Exists on every page is a quick way for a user to find what they are 
looking for. 
• Footer Social Icons - Exists on every page and allows all users to access the social 
platforms that the artist uses. 
• Footer Meet the Band and Menu items – Exists on every page. Adds to aesthetic of the page. • 
Bio & Meet the Band Page - Allows potential fans and business contacts to connect with the 
artists without overloading them with information. 
• Shows Page - Allows all visitors to the website to know when and where the band are 
preforming and when they may be available for bookings 
• Contact Page - Allows potential clients to see the best way to contact the band, in regards 
to professional or personal. 
##### Features to Implement in future
• FAQ page, table with FAQs and dropdown buttons to view answers - Gives potential clients 
easy to find answers to their common questions.
• Blog - Allows new and existing fans to discover the website through articles written by the 
members about topics such as their shows/new music what they have been up to and what they 
would like to accomplish. 
• Option to choose the language of the website - As the band expand it wouldn’t place a limit 
on their following. 
• Promotional Video - Allows potential clients to connect with the artist.
• Add audio and video clips so users can sample the bands work. 
### Technology Used
• This project uses HTML and CSS programming languages. 
• Cloud9 - This developer used Cloud9 for their IDE while building the website. 
• BootstrapCDN 
    o The project uses Bootstrap4 to simplify the structure of the website and make the 
    website responsive easily. 
    o The project also uses BootstrapCDN to provide icons from FontAwesome 
• Google Fonts 
    o The project uses Google fonts to style the website fonts 
• W3Schools
    o This project uses W3Schools to use the coding for the searchbar. 
    o This project also uses W3Schools for the list of colours 
### Testing
• W3C CSS validation 
• W3C Markup Validation 
    o The developer used W3C CSS Validation Service and W3C Markup Validation Service to check 
    the validity of the website code.
